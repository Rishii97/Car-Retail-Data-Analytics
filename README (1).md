# Project Title
## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on analyzing various data characteristics to identify patterns that enhance the marketability of cars. The primary goal is to understand the impact of different features or columns on car pricing. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), regression analysis, and visualization to derive insights for dashboarding.
## Project Scope and Limitations

The project primarily deals with a single-table dataset consisting of normalized tuples. While this dataset provides valuable information, its limitation lies in the lack of diversity and complexity that could be achieved with additional datasets. To enhance the effectiveness of the dashboard, it is recommended to acquire and integrate more datasets that can be joined with the existing database.

## Data cleaning and EDA
The initial steps involve thorough data cleaning to ensure the dataset's integrity. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the relationships between different features and their impact on car pricing. Regression analysis is used to quantify these relationships and derive meaningful insights.

## Dashboarding and Visualization
The insights gained from the analysis are utilized in creating a dashboard using PowerBI. The dashboard visualizes key patterns, trends, and relationships in the data. One of the recommendations for further enhancement is to utilize PowerBI's drill-through features for a more in-depth analysis.

## Recommendations for Improvement

    1. Diversify Data Sources: Acquire additional datasets that can be joined with the existing database to introduce more complexity and depth into the analysis.

    2. Enhance Dashboard Functionality: Explore the use of PowerBI's drill-through features to enable users to dive deeper into specific aspects of the data.

    3. Machine Learning Integration: With a sufficiently large and diverse dataset, consider implementing machine learning algorithms to extract deeper insights into the features influencing a car's Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP).

## Conclusion

This project serves as a foundation for understanding the factors influencing car pricing. By addressing the project's limitations and implementing the recommended enhancements, it has the potential to provide a comprehensive and valuable resource for stakeholders in the automotive industry.
